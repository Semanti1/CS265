Okay, I'm still working on my own understanding here, so, this is not etched
in stone.

\section{Modes}
\label{modes}

\TeX supports 2 basic modes, math and text.

When you're typing along, you're entering text.  Mostly you can just type as
you would, with a few exceptions.  There are metacharacters, paragraphs are
separated by two (or more) newlines.

Whitespace serves to separate words, etc, but in a typeset environment,
sequences of spaces, e.g., aren't of fixed size.

\subsection{Metacharacters}
\label{metacharacters}

The following characters can not simply be typed, as they have special
meaning to \LaTeX{}:

\begin{quote}
	\{~~\}~~\$~~\%~~\_~~\&~~\#~~\^{}~~\textbackslash{}~~\~{}
\end{quote}

Here is how to print these characters in \LaTeX{}.  These metacharacters
will be explained, but for the moment, trust me.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c|l}
		\hline
			\{ & \textbackslash{}\{ \\
		\hline
			\} & \textbackslash{}\} \\
		\hline
			\$ & \textbackslash{}\$ \\
		\hline
			\% & \textbackslash{}\% \\
		\hline
			\& & \textbackslash{}\& \\
		\hline
			\# & \textbackslash{}\# \\
		\hline
			\_ & \textbackslash{}\_ \\
		\hline
			\textbackslash & \textbackslash{}textbackslash \\
		\hline
			\^{} & \textbackslash{}\^{}\{\} \\
		\hline
			\~{} & \textbackslash{}\~{}\{\} \\
			\textasciitilde & \textbackslash{}textasciitilde \\
			$\sim$ & \$\textbackslash{}sim\$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
