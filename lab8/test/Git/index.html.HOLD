<h1> Lab - Git </h1>

<h2> Setup </h2>

<p>
For this lab, you will be creating two repositories just as you saw in
lecture. You <emph>must</emph> create them using exactly the paths specified
below. Remember, the UNIX file system is case sensitive!
</p>

<h2> To Do </h2>

<ol>
	<li>
	  Create a repository at <code>~/cs265/lab3-git</code>.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Create a <em>bare</em> repository at <code>~/cs265/lab3-git-bare</code>.
	</li>

	<li>
		Add your labsheet to the first repository that you created. Commit this
		file to the repository.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Use one of the two methods from lecture to delete your answers. Commit
	  your change.
	</li>

	<li>
		Oops, your work is gone! Check out the version of the labsheet  that had
		all your answers.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Add the answers to the following two questions <emph>to the answer
	  sheet in your git repository</emph>, and to your lab answer sheet (which
		you will submit) :
	  
	  <p><b><font size=+1>Q 1</font></b>: What command did you use to recover your answers after you deleted them?</p>
	  
	  <p><b><font size=+1>Q 2</font></b>: How will we be able to tell if you
	  cheated and never deleted your answers in the first place?</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  Push all your changes from <code>~/cs265/lab3-git</code> to the bare
	  repository <code>~/cs265/lab3-git-bare</code>.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>You do not need to submit anything for this section of the lab. However, you
must make sure that your repositories are located at the paths we specified.</p>
