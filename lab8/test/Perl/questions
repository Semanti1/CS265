2.1	Write a program that computes the circumference of a circle with radius
12.5.  Use $pi = 3.141592654

2.2	Modify the previous program to prompt and read the radius

2.3	Modify the previous program so that if the radius is less than zero, the
circumference is set to zero.

2.4	Write a program that prompts for and reads two numbers, on separate
lines, and prints their product.

2.5	Write a program that prompts for and reads a string and a number (on
separate lines) and prints the string the number of times indicated by the
number (on separate lines).
