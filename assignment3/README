In PhoneDict.java ,  the name of input file is read in from environment variable ACMIA_WORDS. For each word in input file, the corresponding code is generated, and (code ,word) pairs are stored.

While decoding each line from standard input:

1. If blank line is entered , then execution is continued.(Since there is nothing to decode here)
2. If all numbers entered in the code is 0, a blank line is printed. Since leading and trailing zeros are to be ignored, if everything is zero everything is ignored and empty line left.
3. If the numeric code entered is valid(consists of all numbers) then the rules for decoding given in instructions are followed.
4. Program exits only when CTRL+D is pressed or an invalid input is given.
